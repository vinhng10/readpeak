# Interview Questions

### 1. What work have you found most challenging in your career and why?
   The most challenging work I have encountered was building a noise reduction model that works in real-time within a browser. I had to build the model from scratch, and there were very few resources or tutorials available to guide me due to the latency-sensitive nature of this task. The challenge was finding the optimal tradeoff between performance and latency, as many consumer machines lack the hardware to run complex models efficiently. I succeeded in making it work for mid- to high-end consumer laptops, but further improvements are required to support low-end devices.

### 2. What work have you done that you are particularly proud of and why?
   I'm most proud of deploying a feature that I took full ownership of. It was a map and location-based feature, where I had to orchestrate a map server and implement both frontend and backend components. This was a large and complex task, and successfully launching it into production felt like a significant accomplishment.

### 3. When have you been happiest in your professional career and why?
   I am happiest when my code works and creates tangible value. Seeing my work make an impact and help solve real problems is incredibly fulfilling.

### 4. When have you been unhappiest in your professional career and why?
   Office politics and not enough resources to experiment things.

### 5. What are your career goals in 1 year? In 3-5 years?
   In the next 2 years, I aim to reach a senior level in the AI/Data field and become an expert in designing and implementing AI systems.

### 6. What would your ideal workplace look like? How do you see Readpeak fulfilling that vision?
   My ideal workplace presents interesting, challenging problems both from a business and technical standpoint. The problems should be large and complex enough to require both creativity and discipline to solve. I believe Readpeak, with its focus on AI-powered optimization and large-scale traffic handling, offers these types of challenges.

### 7. Why do you want to work for Readpeak?
   I want to work for Readpeak because Iâ€™m excited about the problems the company is solving. Optimizing bidding strategies with AI, handling large-scale traffic systems, and working in a product-focused company align with my professional aspirations.
